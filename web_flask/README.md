# 0x04. AirBnB clone - Web framework

## Description :house:
Flask was an envirponment very suitable for testing purposes. It is not an actual deployment environment.
In this project I began working with Flask
and Jinja. I started integrating the back-end storage engine
with the web static HTML/CSS pages written earlier.

Files 0 - 6 were just introductory tasks to get me familiar with syntaxes in the flask application

The most complete Flask/Jinja app-template combo in this directory is defined
in Flask module [100-hbnb.py](./100-hbnb.py) and Jinja template
[100-hbnb.html](./100-hbnb.html).

To run the Flask app, execute the following command from the root directory
of the project:

```
~ $ HBNB_MYSQL_USER=hbnb_dev HBNB_MYSQL_PWD=hbnb_dev_pwd HBNB_MYSQL_HOST=localhost
HBNB_MYSQL_DB=hbnb_dev_db HBNB_TYPE_STORAGE=db python3 -m web_flask.100-hbnb
```

The app can be accessed at `0.0.0.0:5000/hbnb`.
